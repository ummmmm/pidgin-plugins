These plugins are made for Pidgin.

In order to compile them, you need to download the source of pidgin.  I downloaded pidgin-2.10.9 and then copied the .c files into libpurple/plugins directory.

There, run make <plugin_name>.so and copy the file to your pidgin plugins directory (e.g. /home/dcarver/.purple/plugins)
